I am passionate about helping businesses enhance security, optimize IT operations, and scale through cloud-based solutions. My goal is to bridge the gap between technology and business needs by building secure, efficient, and innovative IT environments.

My hands-on experience spans both Linux and Windows environments, where I work extensively with vulnerability management and threat detection tools such as Tenable Nessus, Qualys, Microsoft Defender, and Microsoft Sentinel & SentinelOne. I also governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), ensuring that security policies align with business goals, while driving initiatives in cloud security, infrastructure hardening, and security monitoring through SIEM and EDR solutions.
